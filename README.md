This is my personal config. I use it on various Debian-based
systems. I put it in ~/stow together with other directories
(site-specific config, https://github.com/ilyagr/stow_nofold repo,
https://github.com/ilyagr/dot_submodules, etc) and then use GNU stow
(see the `c.restow` script) to symlink it to my actual home tree.
